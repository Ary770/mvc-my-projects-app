My Projects

Welcome to My Projects, a Web-based app that keeps track of your projects, whatever they might be. You can organize them into categories, and write ideas, notes, start by, finish by on each project.

Run bundle install, rake db:migrate, start a server with shotgun and you're good to go :)
